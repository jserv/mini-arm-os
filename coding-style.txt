The source code of mini-arm-os follows Linux style formatting/indenting.
You can use `astyle' to indent the source files:

    astyle --style=linux --indent=tab -p -U -K -H --suffix=none

Brackets are broken from namespace, class, and function definitions.
Brackets are attached to statements within a function.  Minimum conditional
indent is one-half indent. It frequently is used with an indent of 8 spaces.

Use tabs for indentation, and spaces for continuation line alignment. This
ensures that the code is displayed correctly regardless of the viewer’s tab
size.

Insert space padding around operators. Any end of line comments will remain in
the original column, if possible.

Remove extra space padding around parenthesis on the inside and outside. Any
end of line comments will remain in the original column, if possible.

Indent 'case  X:' blocks from the 'case  X:' headers. Case statements not
enclosed in blocks are NOT indented.

Insert space padding after paren headers only (e.g. 'if', 'for', 'while'...).
Any end of line comments will remain in the original column, if possible.
